## About

This project focuses on predicting customer churn for an e-commerce company. The company, valued at $1 billion, operates in a highly competitive market where retaining existing customers is significantly more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately identify customers who are likely to churn, thereby enabling the company to implement targeted retention strategies.

The analysis process is as follows:

**Data Loading and Exploration**: Initial data loading, exploration, and cleaning to ensure the dataset is ready for modeling.
**Feature Engineering**: Creating new features or modifying existing ones to improve model performance.
**Model Building**: Developing machine learning models to predict customer churn using algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and more.
**Model Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using various metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.
**Results and Analysis**: Discussing the results, identifying the most important features, and providing insights into customer churn patterns.
